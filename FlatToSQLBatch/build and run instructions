To Build Deployable:

1. manually create folder structure in maven repository - the db2 jars are not built in a format that
is compatible with maven so you will have to copy/rename the jars.(the mvn install:install-file command
does not work with db2 jars less than 10.5 apparently)

2. once the maven repository entries are created the pom will include the db2 jars in the build


from command line in roote directory run
 
 mvn package -DskipTests

open up jar in target directory and delete all the .properties and .bat files , etc - spring boot puts them in the jar and it will interfere with picking 
up the correct properties files

copy jar to deployables/lib; copy .bat files to deployabes/; copy properties files to deployables/ 


To Run:
java -jar lib/[name].jar   --spring.profiles.active=SNAPNDNH --spring.batch.job.names=receiveNDNHJob --nomads.startdate=2006-11-01 --nomads.enddate=2018-04-04
